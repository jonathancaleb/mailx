## Introduction
Plunk is an open-source email platform built on top of AWS SES. It allows you to easily send emails from your applications.
It can be considered as a self-hosted alternative to services like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Resend](https://resend.com) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/).

## Features
- **Transactional Emails**: Send emails straight from your API
- **Automations**: Create automations based on user actions
- **Broadcasts**: Send newsletters and product updates to big audiences

## Self-hosting Plunk
The easiest way to self-host Plunk is by using the `driaug/plunk` Docker image.
You can pull the latest image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/driaug/plunk/).

A complete guide on how to deploy Plunk can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.useplunk.com/getting-started/self-hosting).
