# 📧 mailx - Your Open-Source Email Platform

## Introduction

mailx is an open-source email platform designed to help you send reliable, scalable emails from your applications. Built on top of Google Cloud services, mailx provides a robust, self-hosted alternative to solutions like SendGrid, Resend, or Mailgun, while offering you full control and flexibility. 🚀

This project was developed as a personal initiative to deepen my understanding of cloud platforms, email infrastructure, and system architecture. The design and architecture of mailx are inspired by the open-source foundations of platforms like SendGrid, Plunk, and others, while incorporating my own learning and innovations. 💡

## Features

- **Transactional Emails**: Send highly efficient, secure emails directly from your API. ✉️
- **Automations**: Create smart automations to trigger emails based on user actions or events. 🔄
- **Broadcasts**: Effortlessly send newsletters and product updates to your entire audience with just a few clicks. 📬
